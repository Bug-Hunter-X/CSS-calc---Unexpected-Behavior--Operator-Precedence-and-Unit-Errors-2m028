The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20%);` might not behave as intended because you're subtracting a percentage from a percentage without a clear base.
